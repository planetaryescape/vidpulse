            IMPORTANT REVIEW GUIDELINES:
            - Focus on significant issues: bugs, security vulnerabilities, logic errors, performance problems
            - Do NOT be nitpicky about style, formatting, naming conventions, or minor preferences
            - Skip comments about missing docs/comments unless critical for understanding
            - Only flag issues that would actually cause problems in production
            - Be concise and actionable
          # See https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/usage.md
